# Add Product Form Implementation Plan

## Simplified Approach
We'll implement a simple accordion-style dropdown for the add product form:

1. Form Layout
- Keep existing form fields and structure
- Wrap form in an accordion-style dropdown section
- Form is hidden by default
- Clicking "Add Product" button toggles form visibility

2. Visual Elements
- Clear expand/collapse indicator (▼/▶)
- Smooth transition for expanding/collapsing
- Maintain existing form styling
- Keep all form fields in a single, organized section

3. User Flow
- User clicks "Add Product" to expand form
- Form smoothly slides down to reveal fields
- User fills out fields and submits
- Form collapses after successful submission

This simpler approach will:
- Keep the interface clean and uncluttered
- Make it obvious how to add products
- Maintain all existing functionality
- Provide a familiar accordion pattern users understand

The implementation will require minimal changes to:
- PHP template (wrap form in accordion section)
- CSS (add accordion styles and transitions)
- JavaScript (toggle accordion visibility)

This solution maintains functionality while simplifying the user interface.
